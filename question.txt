q1. Create a program to store and print a person's and their project's details. Declare and initialize variables for the following details,
    Project name (string)
    Code lines written (uint8)
    Bugs found (int)
    Is the project complete? (bool)
    Average lines of code written per hour (float64)
    Team lead name (string)
    Project deadline in days (int)
    Additionally, demonstrate a uint overflow by initializing the largest possible value for uint
    and then adding 1 to it

    // try to use fmt.Printf instead of println
    pkg.go.dev // fmt

q2. Create a stringops package with three files.
         The package should export one function that utilizes internal (unexported) functions.

         Files in stringops Package:
         File 1: strings.go
         Exported Function: TrimSpaceAndUppercase(s1, s2 string)
         File 2: upper.go
         Internal Function: toUpperCase(s string) string
         File 3: trim.go
         Internal Function: trimSpace(s string) string
